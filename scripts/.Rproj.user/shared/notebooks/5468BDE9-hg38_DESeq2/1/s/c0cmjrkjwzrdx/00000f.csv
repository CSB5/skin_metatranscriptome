ComplexHeatmap version 2.12.1
Bioconductor page: http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/
Github page: https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap
Documentation: http://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference

    genomic data. Bioinformatics 2016.

The new InteractiveComplexHeatmap package can directly export static 
complex heatmaps into an interactive Shiny app with zero effort. Have a try!

This message can be suppressed by:
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ComplexHeatmap))
========================================
! pheatmap() has been masked by ComplexHeatmap::pheatmap(). Most of the arguments
   in the original pheatmap() are identically supported in the new function. You 
   can still use the original function by explicitly calling pheatmap::pheatmap().
