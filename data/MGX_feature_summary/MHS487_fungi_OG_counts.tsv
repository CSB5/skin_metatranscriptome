3NW09|Fungi	1	6.289308176100628	K	Component of the FACT complex, a general chromatin factor that acts to reorganize nucleosomes. The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II (By similarity)	MHS487	fungi_OG

PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein PAB1. PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome- mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenlyation- dependent mRNA decaping and subsequent 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. May also be involved in post-transcriptional maturation of mRNA poly(A) tails	MHS487	fungi_OG

3P342|Fungi	4	7.246376811594202	B	Variant histone H2A which can replace H2A in some nucleosomes. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. This variant is enriched at promoters, it may keep them in a repressed state until the appropriate activation signal is received. Near telomeres, it may counteract gene silencing caused by the spread of heterochromatin proteins. Required for the RNA polymerase II and SPT15 TBP recruitment to the target genes.

3P90W|Fungi	1	3.584229390681003	K	Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates to a subcomplex required for deubiquitination of H2B and for the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. May also be involved in cytoplasmic mRNA decay by interaction with components of P-bodies	MHS487	fungi_OG
