3NUIG|Fungi	193	125.04793610306355	L	Component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). Heterodimerizes with msh2 to form MutS beta, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. Msh3 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, the MutS beta heterodimer bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis.

3NWS9|Fungi	220	204.951872918358	A	Regulatory subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) deadenylation complex, one of two cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylases involved in mRNA turnover. PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein pab1. PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome- mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenlyation- dependent mRNA decaping and subsequent 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation by xrn1. May also be involved in post-transcriptional maturation of mRNA poly(A) tails. pan3 acts as a positive regulator for PAN activity, recruiting the catalytic subunit pan2 to mRNA via its interaction with RNA and with pab1	MHS543	fungi_OG

Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the tail- anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting	MHS543	fungi_OG

Components of this complex are involved in the control of mitochondrial shape and protein biogenesis and may function in phospholipid exchange. mdm10 is involved in the late assembly steps of the general translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM complex). Functions in the tom40-specific route of the assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, including the association of tom40 with the receptor tom22 and small TOM proteins. Can associate with the SAM(core) complex as well as the mdm12-mmm1 complex, both involved in late steps of the major beta-barrel assembly pathway, that is responsible for biogenesis of all outer membrane beta-barrel proteins. May act as a switch that shuttles between both complexes and channels precursor proteins into the tom40-specific pathway.

3P25I|Fungi	61	74.63148390500248	I	Catalyzes the third of the four reactions of the long- chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum- bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of two carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids VLCFAs per cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate into trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA, within each cycle of fatty acid elongation. Thereby, it participates to the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators	MHS543	fungi_OG

3P342|Fungi	38	105.76676414755528	B	Variant histone H2A which can replace H2A in some nucleosomes. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. This variant is enriched at promoters, it may keep them in a repressed state until the appropriate activation signal is received. Near telomeres, it may counteract gene silencing caused by the spread of heterochromatin proteins. Required for the RNA polymerase II and SPT15 TBP recruitment to the target genes.

3P34B|Fungi	26	106.6426388763183	C	Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(0) domain and the peripheric stalk, which acts as a stator to hold the catalytic alpha(3)beta(3) subcomplex and subunit a ATP6 static relative to the rotary elements	MHS543	fungi_OG

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA	MHS543	fungi_OG

Serves as sulfur donor in tRNA 2- thiolation reaction by being thiocarboxylated (-COSH) at its C- terminus by the MOCS3 homolog UBA4. The sulfur is then transferred to tRNA to form 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U. Prior mcm(5) tRNA modification by the elongator complex is required for 2- thiolation. Also acts as a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that is covalently conjugated via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of target proteins such as AHP1. The thiocarboxylated form serves as substrate for conjugation and oxidative stress specifically induces the formation of UBL-protein conjugates	MHS543	fungi_OG

Component of the cytoplasmic LSM1-LSM7 complex, which is thought to be involved in mRNA degradation by activating the decapping step in the 5'-to-3' mRNA decay pathway. Component of the nuclear LSM2-LSM8 complex, which is involved in splicing of nuclear mRNAs. LSM2-LSM8 associates with multiple snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA (U4 U6 di-snRNP, spliceosomal U4 U6.U5 tri-snRNP, and free U6 snRNP). It binds directly to the 3'-terminal U-tract of U6 snRNA and plays a role in the biogenesis and stability of the U6 snRNP and U4 U6 snRNP complexes. LSM2-LSM8 probably also is involved degradation of nuclear pre-mRNA by targeting them for decapping, and in processing of pre-tRNAs, pre-rRNAs and U3 snoRNA (By similarity)	MHS543	fungi_OG

3P90W|Fungi	19	68.77503689647901	K	Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates to a subcomplex required for deubiquitination of H2B and for the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. May also be involved in cytoplasmic mRNA decay by interaction with components of P-bodies	MHS543	fungi_OG

May act by forming a heterodimer with NCS6 that ligates sulfur from thiocarboxylated URM1 onto the uridine of tRNAs at wobble position. Prior mcm(5) tRNA modification by the elongator complex is required for 2-thiolation. May also be involved in protein urmylation	MHS543	fungi_OG
