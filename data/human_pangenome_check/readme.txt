These human pangenome indices (extended from chm13) are compatible with vg 1.63.1

The gbz and dist files were downloaded from:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/freeze/freeze1/minigraph-cactus/hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13/hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.gbz
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/freeze/freeze1/minigraph-cactus/hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13/hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.dist

The zipcodes and minimizer files were regenerated by forcing giraffe to rebuild them like so:
~/volume1/bin/vg giraffe -p -t 32 -Z hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.gbz -d hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.dist -f MHS446_merged_1.fastq.gz -f MHS446_merged_2.fastq.gz > MHS446_RAW.gam

Subsequently, the hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.shortread.withzip.min and hprc-v1.1-mc-chm13.shortread.zipcodes can be used as index files for general short read mapping to the human pangenome.
