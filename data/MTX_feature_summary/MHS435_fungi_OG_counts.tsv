Efficiently unwinds G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and forked RNA-DNA hybrids. Resolves G4 structures, preventing replication pausing and double-strand breaks (DSBs) at G4 motifs. Involved in the maintenance of telomeric DNA. Inhibits telomere elongation, de novo telomere formation and telomere addition to DSBs via catalytic inhibition of telomerase. Reduces the processivity of telomerase by displacing active telomerase from DNA ends. Releases telomerase by unwinding the short telomerase RNA telomeric DNA hybrid that is the intermediate in the telomerase reaction. Involved in the maintenance of ribosomal (rDNA). Required for efficient fork arrest at the replicaion fork barrier within rDNA. Involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial (mtDNA). Required to maintain mtDNA under conditions that introduce dsDNA breaks in mtDNA, either preventing or repairing dsDNA breaks. May inhibit replication progression to allow time for repair. May have a general role in chromosomal replication by affecting Okazaki fragment maturation. May have a role in conjunction with DNA2 helicase nuclease in 5'-flap extension during Okazaki fragment processing	MHS435	fungi_OG

3NWS9|Fungi	2	5.649717514124294	A	Regulatory subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) deadenylation complex, one of two cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylases involved in mRNA turnover. PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein pab1. PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome- mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenlyation- dependent mRNA decaping and subsequent 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation by xrn1. May also be involved in post-transcriptional maturation of mRNA poly(A) tails. pan3 acts as a positive regulator for PAN activity, recruiting the catalytic subunit pan2 to mRNA via its interaction with RNA and with pab1	MHS435	fungi_OG

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl- transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. uL10 forms part of the P stalk that participates in recruiting G proteins to the ribosome	MHS435	fungi_OG

Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the tail- anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting	MHS435	fungi_OG

F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation.
