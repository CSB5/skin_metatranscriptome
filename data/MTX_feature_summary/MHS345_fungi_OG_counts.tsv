The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. uL10 forms part of the P stalk that participates in recruiting G proteins to the ribosome	MHS345	fungi_OG
